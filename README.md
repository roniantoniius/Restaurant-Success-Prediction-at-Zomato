## Business Understanding 😇 
This project aims to gain a deeper understanding of the factors that influence Zomato's success in the food and food delivery industry. Using a dataset that records various information about the restaurants listed on the Zomato platform, we will explore trends, patterns, and key factors that can affect the popularity and performance of restaurants.

As a data scientist, my goal is to help restaurant owners, market analysts, and food industry players to understand market dynamics and analyze restaurant characteristics that can improve their success on the Zomato platform. By utilizing machine learning techniques and data analysis, we will strive to identify patterns that can be used to improve customer experience, increase sales, and optimize marketing strategies.

With a better understanding of the factors that influence the success of Zomato companies, it is hoped that restaurant owners and industry players can make more informed and effective decisions in managing their businesses. Ultimately, the project aims to make a positive contribution to the restaurant ecosystem and the food industry as a whole. Let's dive in and explore the world of Zomato! 🍽️🚀
